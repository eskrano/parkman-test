# PHP assignment 

All details described in task.pdf.

## Points to improve code

- add eloquent model for garages in case if we need to create 
- register normal container interface for db driver instead of string 'db'
- add migrations for php? 
- add interface for container proxy service
- add flexibility for filters e.g more params / validations
- pagination ?
- wrap up web/index.php into some static service & routes (make code looks more clear)
- add good CORS (now just copy-pasted from docs , sorry no time )

Proposals??
